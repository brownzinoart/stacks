# Community Integration Strategy

## Current Problem: Community Isolation

**Issue:** Community features currently isolated in separate "Events" tab, missing opportunities for social learning integration throughout the app experience.

**Goal:** Weave community features throughout all tabs to create a social learning ecosystem.
