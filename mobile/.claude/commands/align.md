Use the **align-architect** subagent to align this repository to the user's direction.

Inputs:

- Goals: "{{goals}}"
- Constraints: "{{constraints}}"

If critical unknowns exist, ask 3â€“6 sharp questions but proceed with reasonable defaults.
At the end, emit `__STATUS__`, a suggested `__QUEUE__`, and `__NEXT_AGENT__` to **product** by default.
