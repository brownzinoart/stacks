## The Ultimate Vision

**Transform the relationship between digital convenience and physical community spaces**

Instead of digital replacing physical, Stacks makes digital discovery the gateway to richer physical experiences. Users become addicted not just to their phones, but to the discovery adventures their phones unlock in the real world.

**Success looks like:**

- People walking into libraries with phones in hand, excited to find their discoveries
- AR-guided exploration becoming as common as GPS navigation
- Library visits increasing because digital tools make them more valuable, not less
- Communities forming around shared physical and digital discovery experiences
- Libraries becoming discovery destinations rather than just book storage

**The device addiction becomes the solution, not the problem.**
