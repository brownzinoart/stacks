## Discovery-First Mental Model

### **Discovery Hierarchy:**

```
🔍 DISCOVERY (Primary Mental Model)
├── 📚 Book Discovery
│   ├── Natural language input → AI recommendations
│   ├── Mood-based book finding
│   ├── Genre/topic exploration
│   └── Serendipitous "surprise me" options
├── 🎯 Topic Discovery
│   ├── "What should I learn about X?"
│   ├── Structured learning paths (subset of discovery)
│   └── Skill-building book sequences
├── 📍 Physical Discovery
│   ├── AR shelf scanning at library
│   ├── AR navigation to specific books
│   ├── Library branch exploration
│   └── Hidden gems on shelves
├── 🤝 Social Discovery
│   ├── What are others in my area reading?
│   ├── Community recommendations
│   ├── Local reading groups and events
│   └── Librarian picks and staff recommendations
└── 🌟 Contextual Discovery
    ├── Location-based recommendations
    ├── Time-sensitive suggestions (holidays, events)
    ├── Personal life events (new job, moving, etc.)
    └── Trending local interests
```

**Key Insight:** Learning paths become "structured discovery sequences" rather than educational curricula.

```

## Digital-to-Physical Bridge Strategy

### **The Core Value Loop:**

```
1. DIGITAL DISCOVERY (In App)
   ├── Natural language input → AI recommendations
   ├── Personalized discovery feed
   ├── Community recommendations
   └── Mood/topic-based suggestions

2. PHYSICAL CONNECTION (Library Visit)
   ├── Reserved books ready for pickup
   ├── AR navigation to find books
   ├── Shelf scanning for additional discoveries
   └── Physical browsing enhanced by digital tools

3. ENHANCED DISCOVERY (Back to Digital)
   ├── Share physical discoveries with community
   ├── Track reading progress and new interests
   ├── Get recommendations based on physical browsing
   └── Plan next library visit
```

### **Digital Hooks to Drive Physical Visits:**

- **Hold Notifications:** "Your discovery is ready for pickup"
- **AR Missions:** "Complete your discovery quest at the library"
- **Social Events:** "Discovery meetup at library tonight"
- **Limited Availability:** "Last copy available - grab it today"
- **Discovery Streaks:** "Keep your discovery streak alive with a library visit"

### **Physical Enhancements Through Digital:**

- **AR Shelf Scanning:** Transform browsing into personalized discovery
- **Digital Breadcrumbs:** Track discovery journey through library
- **Community Layer:** See what others discovered in same sections
- **Staff Integration:** Digital connection to librarian recommendations

---

## Success Metrics (Discovery-Focused)

### **Discovery Effectiveness:**

- Books discovered per user per month
- Discovery method diversity (natural language, AR, social, etc.)
- Conversion from discovery to library visit
- Time from discovery to book pickup

### **Physical Library Engagement:**

- Library visits driven by app recommendations
- AR feature usage during library visits
- Books found through physical browsing vs. pre-planned
- Library staff interaction facilitated by app

### **Community Discovery:**

- User-shared discoveries per month
- Cross-user discovery adoption (people finding books through others)
- Local discovery group formation and participation
- Discovery challenge completion rates

### **Digital-Physical Bridge:**

- Percentage of discoveries that lead to library visits
- AR usage for book finding in libraries
- Community discoveries made during physical visits
- User retention correlated with library visit frequency

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Discovery Core (Weeks 1-2)**

- Redesign Discover tab with multiple discovery pathways
- Enhance natural language discovery (current strength)
- Add mood-based and surprise discovery options
- Implement discovery feed with personalization

### **Phase 2: Physical Bridge (Weeks 3-4)**

- Strengthen library integration and book reservations
- Enhance AR features for in-library discovery
- Add discovery missions and gamified exploration
- Implement community layer for physical spaces

### **Phase 3: Social Discovery (Weeks 5-6)**

- Launch community discovery sharing

- Add discovery challenges and achievements
- Create family discovery experiences

### **Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 7-8)**

- Optimize digital-to-physical conversion flow
- Enhance personalization based on discovery patterns
- Scale community features based on engagement

---

## Key Messaging Shift

### **Old Mental Model:**

"Learn something new through structured paths"

### **New Mental Model:**

"Discover your next great read and find it at your library"

**Benefits of Discovery-First:**

- ✅ More engaging and accessible to broader audience
- ✅ Natural fit with library browsing behavior
- ✅ Includes learning without being intimidating
- ✅ Better alignment with social sharing ("I discovered...")
- ✅ More flexible for different user intents and moods
- ✅ Stronger connection to physical library experience

The revised strategy positions Stacks as the ultimate book discovery app that bridges digital convenience with physical library magic.
