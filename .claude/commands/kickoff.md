description: Kick off a new project: collect brief, constraints, scope, and first milestone with owners. Suggest a plan; do not auto-run without consent.
---

Act as **orchestrator** then **product** to collect a lean brief:

- Problem & audience
- Constraints (time, budget, platform)
- Success metrics
- Milestone 1 scope (1â€“2 weeks), owner, definition of done

If consent to run is not explicit, propose a plan and emit `__QUEUE__` only.
If consent is explicit, emit `__QUEUE__` + `__NEXT_AGENT__`.
