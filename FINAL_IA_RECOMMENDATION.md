## Migration Strategy from Current IA

### **Current → New Mapping:**

```
CURRENT STRUCTURE:
AR | Explore | Stacks | Events | Profile

NEW STRUCTURE:
Home | Learn | Explore | Community | Family

MIGRATION PLAN:
├── Current "Stacks" content → New "Home" (dashboard approach)
├── Current "AR" features → Integrated into new "Explore"
├── Current "Explore" search → Enhanced in new "Explore"
├── Current "Events" → Integrated throughout + dedicated "Community"
└── Current "Profile" → Basic profile + new "Family" tab
```

### **Phase 1: Core Restructure (Week 1-2)**

1. Implement new Home dashboard
2. Migrate AI prompt and reading tools from current Stacks
3. Consolidate AR features into single Explore tab
4. Test new entry point experience

### **Phase 2: Community Integration (Week 3-4)**

1. Add community elements to Home and Learn tabs
2. Enhance Community tab with activity feed
3. Implement basic group formation tools
4. Test community engagement features

### **Phase 3: Family Features (Week 5-6)**

1. Develop Family tab with age-appropriate content
2. Add family mode toggle to other tabs
3. Implement parent-child learning features
4. Test family user experience

### **Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)**

1. A/B test different Home layouts
2. Optimize community integration based on usage data
3. Refine family features based on feedback
4. Performance and accessibility improvements

## Final Recommendation Summary

**Primary Change:** Replace current "Stacks" tab with "Home" dashboard that serves as an effective entry point for all user types and intents.

**Core Improvement:** Integrate community features throughout the experience rather than isolating them in a single tab.

**Strategic Direction:** Adopt hybrid audience approach with adult-primary focus and strong family secondary market.

**Implementation Priority:** Start with Home tab restructure, then integrate community features, finally add comprehensive family experience.

This redesign addresses your original concerns while building on the strong foundation you've already created, particularly the excellent AR integration and mobile-first design approach.
