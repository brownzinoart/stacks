# Stacks - Modern Library Web App

A modern, AI-powered library discovery platform that transforms how users find and engage with books. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Supabase account (for database and auth)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stacks_app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your actual API keys and configuration
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the migration file `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - Enable the pgvector extension in your Supabase dashboard

4. **Initialize git hooks:**
   ```bash
   npx husky install
   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
   chmod +x .husky/commit-msg
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start the backend API server (in a separate terminal):

```bash
npm run backend:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

Recent performance improvements implemented:

- **Image Optimization** - Enabled Next.js built-in image optimization for faster loading
- **Component Memoization** - Added React.memo to BookCover component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Network Optimization** - Replaced axios with native fetch API for reduced bundle size
- **Computation Caching** - Implemented useMemo for expensive similarity calculations
- **Code Splitting** - Added dynamic imports for heavy components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memory Management** - Fixed event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Performance Tips for Developers

- Use `React.memo()` for components that receive stable props
- Implement `useMemo()` for expensive calculations or data transformations
- Use dynamic imports for components that aren't needed immediately
- Always clean up event listeners, timers, and subscriptions in useEffect
- Prefer native fetch over external HTTP libraries when possible
- Enable Next.js image optimization for all image components

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics during development:

- **FMP (First Meaningful Paint)** - Target ≤ 1.8s on 3G
- **Bundle Size** - Check webpack-bundle-analyzer for large chunks
- **Memory Usage** - Use Chrome DevTools to detect memory leaks
- **Re-render Count** - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify unnecessary renders
