## ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Button Sizing Implementation (Priority: Medium)
**Issue:** Button size classes not consistently found in rendered HTML
- Expected: `min-h-touch-sm`, `min-h-touch-md`, `min-h-touch-lg` classes
- Found: Classes present in component code but not always applied in DOM
- Impact: Some buttons may not meet exact 36px/44px/52px touch targets

**Recommendation:** Verify Tailwind compilation and ensure classes are being applied correctly

### 2. Focus States (Priority: Medium)  
**Issue:** Some interactive elements lack visible focus indicators
- Expected: Ring outlines or box-shadow focus states
- Found: Focus states not consistently visible across all browsers
- Impact: Keyboard users may have difficulty seeing focused elements

**Recommendation:** Add explicit focus:ring classes to all interactive components

### 3. Page Title Loading (Priority: Low)
**Issue:** Page title sometimes empty during initial load
- Expected: "Home - Stacks" title
- Found: Empty title during loading state
- Impact: Minor accessibility issue for screen readers

**Recommendation:** Ensure title is set during loading states
