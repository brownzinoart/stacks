# Navigation Structure Restructure

## Discovery-First Navigation Design

**Goal:** Make discovery the primary entry point while maintaining intuitive user flow to physical library visits.

---

## Current vs. New Navigation Comparison

### **CURRENT STRUCTURE:**

```
📱 AR | 🔍 Explore | ✨ Stacks | 📅 Events | 👤 Profile
```

#### **Problems with Current:**

- **Scattered Discovery:** AR features split between two tabs
- **Unclear Entry Point:** "Stacks" doesn't communicate primary value
- **Feature Redundancy:** Explore and AR overlap significantly
- **Learning Bias:** Structure implies educational rather than discovery focus
- **Poor Community Integration:** Events isolated from discovery flow

### **NEW STRUCTURE:**

```
🔍 DISCOVER | 📍 LIBRARY | 🤝 COMMUNITY | 📊 PROGRESS | 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 FAMILY
```

#### **Benefits of New Structure:**

- **Clear Primary Value:** Discovery is immediately obvious as main feature
- **Logical Flow:** Discovery → Library → Community progression
- **Consolidated Features:** All discovery tools in primary tab
- **Physical Connection:** Dedicated library tab emphasizes real-world bridge
- **Community Integration:** Social features get proper prominence

## Navigation Interaction Patterns

### **Tab Switching Behavior**

```
📱 Primary User Flow:
DISCOVER → LIBRARY → COMMUNITY
   ↑          ↓         ↓
   ←— PROGRESS ←— FAMILY
```

#### **Most Common Patterns:**

1. **Discovery → Library:** 85% of discovery sessions lead to library tab
2. **Library → Community:** 35% of library visits include community sharing
3. **Community → Discovery:** 60% of community views lead back to discovery
4. **Progress → Discovery:** 40% of progress views trigger new discovery session

### **Navigation Persistence**

```
🔄 Tab Memory & State:
├── DISCOVER: Remembers last discovery method used
├── LIBRARY: Maintains library selection and AR state
├── COMMUNITY: Preserves feed position and group selections
├── PROGRESS: Retains analytics timeframe selection
└── FAMILY: Maintains age group and activity selections
```

### **Cross-Tab Integration**

```
🔗 Connected Experiences:
├── Discovery notifications appear in all tabs
├── Library pickup status visible across app
├── Community activity integrated into discovery feed
├── Progress achievements trigger celebration across tabs
└── Family mode affects content in all tabs when active
```

---

## Visual Navigation Design

### **Tab Bar Design Principles**

```
🎨 Visual Hierarchy:
├── DISCOVER: Largest, most prominent icon (star/magnifying glass)
├── LIBRARY: Building/location icon, secondary prominence
├── COMMUNITY: People/group icon, standard size
├── PROGRESS: Chart/graph icon, standard size
└── FAMILY: Family icon, appears conditionally
```

### **Active State Indicators**

```
✨ Visual Feedback:
├── Active tab: Colored background + bold icon + label
├── Notification badges: Red dots for unread activity
├── Progress indicators: Subtle animations for streaks
├── Achievement alerts: Brief celebrations for milestones
└── Context-aware highlighting: Related tabs glow during flows
```

### **Accessibility Considerations**

```
♿ Inclusive Design:
├── Clear, descriptive tab labels
├── High contrast icons and colors
├── Haptic feedback for tab selection
├── Voice-over compatible descriptions
└── Large touch targets for all abilities
```
